// 45 Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function Car(manufacturer, model, keywords, color, feature = "Power Steering",) {
    return {
        manufacturer,
        model,
        color,
        feature,
        keywords
    }
}

console.log(Car("Impala", 1967, ["vintage", "fast"], "black",))
